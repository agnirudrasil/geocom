# Maps
## Introduction
Contributor: Agnirudra Sil

My project focused on creating a local navigation system tailored specifically for our college campus. The goal of this system is to help students, staff, and visitors find the quickest path to any building or location within the campus grounds. By calculating the shortest route, this system makes it easy for anyone to navigate efficiently from one point to another, saving time and reducing confusion.

This system is especially useful for new students, such as first-year students, who might not be familiar with the layout of the campus yet. Instead of struggling to find classrooms, labs, or other facilities, users can rely on this navigation tool to confidently get where they need to go. Ultimately, this project aims to make our campus more accessible and welcoming, ensuring that everyone—especially newcomers—can move around smoothly and make the most of their time here.



## Design

## Implementation

## Execution
Let us take a realistic situation, Suppose I am first year student. Being new to the college, I am not very much aware of the campus.
Let us say there is an event taking place at LHC-C and I wish to know the quickest path to reach there. Here is where my system would come to aid.

First, Open the app and enter your current location (In my case block 1 hostel- karavalli) then enter the location you wish to reach-destination (LHC-C).

The app would immediately give me the shortest path to reach LHC-C. In this case, it would take me on the sky-walk and give me a rough estimate of the time it would take to reach there.

Also, the app allows me to know if the destination location is open or closed
